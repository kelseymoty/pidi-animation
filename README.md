# pidi-animation
This repository contains code used for stimulus animation for a project on children's inferences from generic language. 

This study consists of two conditions: 
- knowledgeable speaker
- unknowledgeable speaker

There are five phases of the experimental task:
- introduction
- four test trials (same trial but with four different actions):
  1. baking pizzas
  2. taking photos
  3. painting pictures
  4. playing the piano
  
There are versions of each of these five phases for both conditions. Hence, there are 10 html files. 

The assets folders contains the images and audio used in the animation. 

These animations will be saved into video format and displayed using the following experimental design application: www.github.com/nyu-cdsc/toku
